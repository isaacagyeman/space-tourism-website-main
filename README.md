### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned
Before this project I use to write single webpages but this project gave me a bigger perspective to write the pages for 
mobile, desktop and tablet screens to enhance my responsive design capabilities.


### Continued development
I plan using the data.json file that was provided for this challenge to try and populate the webpages.


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schoools.com) - This helped me as a reference guide to elements or tags I haven't used before eg:(picture tag)
- [Scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - This is an amazing tutorial helped me to compare my work with the one from this tutorial 
to measure how well I pulled this off.
